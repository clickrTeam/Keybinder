/// This function uses systemd's sd-device API to enumerate input devices
/// and filter for those that udev has already marked as keyboards
/// (ID_INPUT_KEYBOARD=1). If multiple candidate devices are found, it
/// further refines the choice by checking with libevdev whether the
/// device has the expected set of alphanumeric + modifier keys.

/// the user can press the spacebar to identify the correct device.

/// representative keys that only a real alphanumeric keyboard would have.
///

///  - KEY_A and KEY_Z  → ensures alphabetic range is present
///  - KEY_SPACE        → ensures spacebar exists

/// This function opens /dev/uinput and registers a new virtual input device
/// that behaves like a keyboard. It enables support for key events (EV_KEY)
/// and synchronization events (EV_SYN), then marks all possible key codes
/// (0..KEY_MAX) as supported. The device is given a USB-like identity and the
/// name "clickr_virtual_keyboard", and is created in the kernel
/// so it appears as an input device (e.g., /dev/input/eventX).
///
/// On success, the file descriptor for the created uinput device is returned.
/// On failure, the function prints an error and returns -1.
